      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "An index fund is an investment fund that aims to track the performance of a specific market index (like the S&P 500 or Dow Jones Industrial Average). Rather than trying to outperform the market, index funds simply mirror the performance of their target index by holding similar investments in similar proportions. They typically have lower fees than actively managed funds and provide broad market exposure with a single investment."

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Dividend investing is a strategy that focuses on buying stocks in companies that regularly pay dividends to shareholders. These are typically well-established companies with stable cash flows. Dividend investors can use these regular payments as income or reinvest them to buy more shares. This strategy is often favored by income-focused or conservative investors, particularly those approaching or in retirement."

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Yield to maturity (YTM) is the total return anticipated on a bond if it is held until it matures. It considers the bond's current market price, its face value, coupon rate, and time to maturity, and assumes all coupon payments are reinvested at the same rate. YTM is expressed as an annual percentage rate and represents a bond's true expected return, making it a more comprehensive measure than just looking at the coupon rate."

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A limit order is an instruction to buy or sell a stock at a specific price or better. For buy limit orders, the execution will only happen at the specified price or lower. For sell limit orders, the execution will only happen at the specified price or higher. Unlike market orders, which execute immediately at the current market price, limit orders give investors control over the price at which their trades are executed, but there's no guarantee the order will be filled."

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A short squeeze occurs when a stock's price increases rapidly, forcing short sellers to buy shares to close their positions and cut losses. This buying activity further drives up the price, creating a reinforcing cycle. Short squeezes typically happen to heavily shorted stocks when unexpected positive news or increased buying pressure causes the price to rise. The GameStop (GME) price surge in early 2021 is a famous example of a short squeeze amplified by retail investor coordination."

It's the portion of your income available for non-essential expenses like entertainment, vacations, or additional savings. Calculating your discretionary income helps you understand how much flexibility you have in your budget and where you might be able to cut back if needed."

      "explanation": "Hedonic adaptation (also called the hedonic treadmill) refers to our tendency to quickly return to a baseline level of happiness after positive changes, including purchases. Initially, buying something new brings pleasure, but we soon adapt and the satisfaction fades, often leading to desire for the next purchase. This psychological phenomenon helps explain why material purchases often don't bring lasting happiness and why increased spending doesn't correlate with increased wellbeing beyond meeting basic needs."

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Simple interest is calculated only on the initial principal amount. Compound interest is calculated on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. For example, if you invest $1,000 at 5% simple interest for 3 years, you'll earn $50 each year for a total of $150. With compound interest, you'd earn $50 the first year, $52.50 the second year (5% of $1,050), and $55.13 the third year (5% of $1,102.50) for a total of $157.63."

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) insurance means that if a bank fails, the government will protect your deposits up to $250,000 per depositor, per bank, per ownership category. For example, if you have $300,000 in one bank account, $50,000 would be uninsured. However, if you have $200,000 in one bank and $200,000 in another, both amounts would be fully insured.

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A credit limit is the maximum amount you can charge to a credit card or line of credit. This limit is set by the lender based on factors like your income, credit score, and existing debt. Once you reach your credit limit, you can't make additional purchases until you pay down the balance. Consistently staying well below your credit limit (ideally below 30%) is good for your credit score."

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A credit freeze (also called a security freeze) restricts access to your credit report, making it nearly impossible for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. When you freeze your credit, you'll need to temporarily lift the freeze when you want to apply for new credit. Credit freezes don't affect your existing credit accounts or credit score. Since 2018, placing and lifting credit freezes has been free at all three major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion)."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A tax credit directly reduces your tax bill, dollar-for-dollar. For example, a $1,000 tax credit reduces your taxes owed by $1,000, regardless of your tax bracket. A tax deduction reduces your taxable income, so its value depends on your tax bracket. For someone in the 22% tax bracket, a $1,000 deduction would save $220 in taxes. This makes credits generally more valuable than deductions of the same amount."

      "explanation": "The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) is a parallel tax system designed to ensure that high-income taxpayers pay at least a minimum amount of tax, regardless of deductions and credits they might claim under the regular tax system. Taxpayers who might be subject to AMT must calculate their tax liability twice—once under regular income tax rules and once under AMT rules—and pay whichever amount is higher. The AMT disallows certain deductions and has its own rates and exemptions."

      "explanation": "A 401(k) plan is an employer-sponsored retirement savings plan that allows employees to contribute a portion of their wages to individual accounts with tax advantages. Traditional 401(k) contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, reducing current taxable income, while earnings grow tax-deferred until withdrawal in retirement. Many employers also offer matching contributions, effectively providing 'free money' toward your retirement, making 401(k)s a powerful tool for long-term retirement saving."

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Catch-up contributions are additional amounts that individuals age 50 and older can contribute to their retirement accounts beyond the standard annual limits. This provision helps those closer to retirement boost their savings during their final working years. For example, in 2023, the standard 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500, but those 50 and older can contribute an additional $7,500, for a total of $30,000.

It typically covers doctor visits, hospital stays, prescription drugs, preventive care, and other medical expenses. Without health insurance, a serious illness or injury could lead to significant financial hardship or bankruptcy.

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The out-of-pocket maximum is the most you'll have to pay for covered healthcare services during a plan year. Once you reach this amount, your insurance will pay 100% of the costs for covered services. This limit includes deductibles, coinsurance, copayments, and other qualified medical expenses. It does not include premiums or spending on non-covered services. The out-of-pocket maximum provides financial protection against catastrophic medical costs."

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Interest is the cost of borrowing money, typically expressed as a percentage of the loan amount (interest rate). It's essentially the fee you pay to use someone else's money. On a loan, you pay interest to the lender; on a deposit account, you earn interest from the bank.

      "explanation": "Cosigning a loan means agreeing to take legal responsibility for the debt if the primary borrower fails to make payments. Cosigners are typically needed when the primary borrower has insufficient credit history or income to qualify alone. As a cosigner, the loan appears on your credit report, affects your debt-to-income ratio, and any missed payments will damage your credit score. If the primary borrower defaults, you're fully responsible for repaying the remaining balance."

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Mean reversion is a theory suggesting that asset prices and returns eventually move back toward their long-term average or mean. This concept is important for long-term savers because it suggests that periods of unusually high returns are likely to be followed by lower returns, and vice versa, which affects saving and withdrawal strategies."

      "explanation": "A 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement savings plan that allows employees to contribute a portion of their wages to individual accounts. Many employers match a percentage of employee contributions. These plans offer tax advantages, as contributions can be made pre-tax, reducing current taxable income. Earnings grow tax-deferred until withdrawal during retirement."

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "An IRA (Individual Retirement Arrangement or Account) is a tax-advantaged investment account designed to help individuals save for retirement. Unlike 401(k) plans, IRAs are not typically associated with an employer and must be opened by individuals. There are several types, including Traditional IRAs (tax-deductible contributions with tax-deferred growth) and Roth IRAs (after-tax contributions with tax-free growth)."

      "explanation": "The primary difference is when taxes are paid. With a Traditional IRA, you may be able to deduct contributions from your taxes now, but you'll pay income tax when you withdraw the money in retirement. With a Roth IRA, you contribute already-taxed money, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are completely tax-free, including all earnings. This makes Roth IRAs particularly valuable if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement."

      "explanation": "A 'backdoor Roth IRA' is a legal strategy that allows individuals whose income exceeds the limits for direct Roth IRA contributions to still fund a Roth IRA. The process involves making a non-deductible contribution to a Traditional IRA (which has no income limits) and then converting those funds to a Roth IRA.

      "explanation": "Sequence of returns risk refers to the impact that the order of investment returns can have on a retirement portfolio when withdrawals are being made. Negative returns in the early years of retirement, combined with withdrawals, can deplete a portfolio more quickly than the same returns occurring later in retirement. This risk is particularly important during the transition from accumulation to withdrawal phase and in the first few years of retirement."

      "explanation": "A deductible is the amount you must pay out-of-pocket for covered services before your insurance begins to pay. For example, if your health insurance has a $1,000 deductible, you'll need to pay the first $1,000 of covered medical expenses yourself. Generally, policies with higher deductibles have lower premiums, as you're assuming more of the initial risk."

For example, you might have a $25 copay for a doctor visit or a $10 copay for a prescription. Copays are a form of cost-sharing between you and your insurance company and help keep premiums lower by ensuring that policyholders share some of the cost of services."

If you outlive the term, the coverage ends with no value. Whole life insurance provides coverage for your entire life as long as premiums are paid, and also includes a cash value component that grows over time.

For example, if your plan has a 20% coinsurance, you pay 20% of the allowed amount for services and your insurance pays the other 80%. This is different from a copay, which is a fixed amount rather than a percentage. Coinsurance applies until you reach your plan's out-of-pocket maximum."

For example, if you're liable for $1 million in damages but your auto insurance only covers $300,000, an umbrella policy could cover the remaining $700,000 (subject to its own limits).

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Adverse selection occurs when people with higher-than-average risk are more likely to seek insurance or higher levels of coverage. This happens because they know more about their own risk factors than the insurance company does. For example, people with health issues may be more likely to purchase health insurance. If left unchecked, this can lead to higher premiums for everyone as the insured pool becomes dominated by higher-risk individuals. Insurance companies use underwriting, medical exams, and other screening methods to mitigate adverse selection."

It's essentially a form of self-insurance, where the insured owns its insurer. Captives are formed for various reasons, including providing coverage when it's unavailable or too expensive in the commercial market, better control over claims, direct access to reinsurance markets, and potential tax advantages.

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The loss ratio is the ratio of total insurance claims paid out by an insurer divided by the total premiums collected during the same period. For example, if an insurer collects $1 million in premiums and pays out $750,000 in claims, the loss ratio is 75%. This key metric helps assess an insurer's profitability and pricing adequacy. A consistently high loss ratio (above 100%) means the company is paying out more in claims than it's collecting in premiums, which is unsustainable long-term."

For example, someone with comprehensive auto insurance might park in riskier locations than if they were uninsured. Insurance companies address moral hazard through deductibles, copayments, coverage limits, and policy exclusions - all designed to ensure the policyholder maintains some financial stake in preventing losses."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Secured debt is backed by an asset (collateral) that the lender can claim if you fail to repay the loan. Common examples include mortgages (secured by your home) and auto loans (secured by your vehicle). Unsecured debt has no collateral backing it, so the lender has no immediate claim to any specific asset if you default. Examples include most credit cards, personal loans, and student loans. Because secured debt is less risky for lenders, it typically has lower interest rates than unsecured debt."

      "options": [
        "The ratio of a country's national debt to its GDP",
        "The percentage of your monthly gross income that goes toward paying debts",

        "The percentage of your total debt that has been repaid"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The debt-to-income (DTI) ratio is calculated by dividing your total monthly debt payments by your gross monthly income, expressed as a percentage. For example, if you have $2,000 in monthly debt payments and a gross monthly income of $6,000, your DTI ratio is 33%. Lenders use this ratio to assess your ability to manage monthly payments and repay debts. A lower DTI ratio suggests better financial health, and many mortgage lenders prefer a DTI ratio of 43% or less."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Credit utilization ratio is the percentage of your available credit that you're currently using. It's calculated by dividing your total credit card balances by your total credit limits. For example, if you have $3,000 in credit card debt and a total credit limit of $10,000 across all cards, your utilization ratio is 30%. Credit scoring models consider this ratio when calculating your credit score, with lower utilization (generally below 30%) being better for your score."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Defaulting on a loan means failing to repay it according to the terms agreed to in the loan contract, typically by missing payments for an extended period. The specific conditions that constitute default vary by loan type and lender, but it's generally a serious situation that can result in collection actions, damage to your credit score, possible legal action, and, in the case of secured loans, repossession of the collateral (such as a home foreclosure or vehicle repossession)."

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Refinancing involves replacing an existing loan with a new loan, typically with more favorable terms such as a lower interest rate, lower monthly payment, or shorter loan term. People often refinance mortgages, auto loans, student loans, or personal loans when interest rates drop, their credit score improves, or their financial situation changes. While refinancing can save money in the long run, it often involves upfront costs and fees that should be factored into the decision."

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The debt avalanche method involves paying the minimum required payment on all debts while putting any extra money toward the debt with the highest interest rate. Once that debt is paid off, you add its payment amount to the minimum payment on the debt with the next highest interest rate, creating a snowball effect. This strategy minimizes the total interest paid and the time to become debt-free, making it mathematically the most efficient repayment method."

Once that debt is paid off, you add its payment amount to the minimum payment on the next smallest debt.

      "explanation": "Debt consolidation is the process of combining multiple debts into a single loan or credit card, usually with a lower interest rate. This can simplify your finances by giving you just one payment to manage instead of many, potentially reduce your interest costs, and sometimes lower your monthly payment. Common consolidation methods include personal loans, balance transfer credit cards, home equity loans, and debt management plans through credit counseling agencies."

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A debt management plan (DMP) is a structured repayment plan set up through a credit counseling agency. In a DMP, the counseling agency works with your creditors to potentially secure lower interest rates, waived fees, and an affordable monthly payment. You make one monthly payment to the agency, which then distributes the funds to your various creditors. DMPs typically take 3-5 years to complete and are designed for unsecured debts like credit cards."

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Amortization is the process of paying off a debt over time through regular payments that cover both principal and interest. In an amortizing loan like a mortgage or car loan, earlier payments primarily go toward interest, while later payments primarily go toward principal. This is shown in an amortization schedule, which details each payment and how it's divided between principal and interest. By the end of the loan term, the debt is fully paid off, or 'amortized.'"

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Debt forbearance is a temporary postponement or reduction of loan payments granted by a lender during a period of financial hardship. Unlike deferment, interest typically continues to accrue during forbearance, which means your balance may grow. Forbearance is often used with student loans, mortgages, and other types of debt when borrowers face temporary financial challenges. It's important to understand that forbearance doesn't erase the debt; it just provides temporary relief."

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Chapter 7 bankruptcy involves the liquidation of non-exempt assets to pay creditors, with remaining eligible debts discharged. It's generally completed in 3-6 months and is available to individuals below certain income thresholds. Chapter 13 bankruptcy involves creating a three- to five-year repayment plan that allows you to keep your assets while repaying all or a portion of your debts. It's available to individuals with regular income and debt below certain limits. Both types impact credit scores significantly but can provide a fresh financial start."

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A debt covenant is a contractual restriction or requirement placed on a borrower by a lender as part of a debt agreement. These provisions are designed to protect the lender's interests by requiring the borrower to maintain certain financial ratios (like debt-to-income), prohibiting certain actions (like taking on additional debt), or requiring certain actions (like maintaining insurance). Violating a covenant can trigger a default, even if payments are current, giving the lender the right to demand immediate repayment or take other remedial actions."

      "explanation": "A debt-for-equity swap is a transaction where a company's debt is exchanged for an equity position (ownership stake) in the company. This typically occurs when a company is in financial distress and unable to service its debt. By converting debt to equity, the company reduces its debt burden and interest expenses, while former creditors become shareholders. While this dilutes existing shareholders, it can help prevent bankruptcy and provide creditors with potential upside if the company recovers."

      "explanation": "Zombie debt refers to old debts that have been 'brought back to life' through aggressive collection attempts, even though they may be past the statute of limitations for legal collection, already paid, discharged in bankruptcy, or not actually owed by the person being contacted. Collection agencies often purchase these old debts for pennies on the dollar and then attempt to collect the full amount. Consumers should be aware that making even a small payment on zombie debt can 'reset' the statute of limitations in some jurisdictions, making the debt legally collectible again."
